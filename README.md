# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis 
### Purpose:
The purpose of this analyis was to create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride sharing data based of city type. 
Analysing the changes in the data based on city type can help us analyse trends that we may not have been able to before.

## Results 
### Total rides 
In our analysis we found that:
- Total rides in Rural cities were the lowest with 125 total rides reported
- Total rides in Urban cities were the highest with 1,625 total rides reported
- Total rides in Suburban cities were in the middle with 1,625 total rides reported
### Total drivers
Total drivers among cities varied with:
- 537 drivers in Rural cities 
- 8,570 drivers  in Suburban cities 
- 9,602 drivers in Urban cities 
### Total fares
Total fares per cities were 
- $4,327.93 in Rural cities 
- $19,356.33	in Suburban cities 
- $39,854.38	in Urban
### Average fare per ride 
- $34.62 in Rural cities 
- $30.97 in Suburban cities 
- $24.53	in Urban cities 
### Average fare per driver
- $8.06 in Rural cities
- $2.26 in Suburban cities 
- $0.67 in Urban cities 

### Conclusions from Findings 
- Based on these findings, we see that there is an increase in total rides, total drivers and total fares the closer we get to "Urban cities". Urban cities are cities such as NYC, LA or Miami. These types of cities are dense in population and therefore as our data confirms, yields more profit (Total fare). With population increasing the closer we get to Urban cities,  average fare per ride and driver both decrease the closer we get towards Urban cities. 
- Rural cities yield the least amount of money (Total fares) and has the least amount total drivers and rides. This is not surprising as well because people that live in rural cities tend to drive more and therefore don't need to ride share as much. Less people sharing rides means less of a need for drivers . Less people ridesharing also means a smaller total fare. When we devide this total fare with the little bit amount of people that live in rural cities, were are left with a larger Average share per ride.
- Suburban cities fall right in the middle between Rural and Urban cities when it comes to total drivers, rides and fares as well as vaergade fare per ride and driver.

## Summary 
### Recommendations 
- Based on these findings the CEO should think about trying to focus on finding out whether the disparities in the data are a result of needs differences or lack of resources (drivers).
- Look to level average fare prices between city types. (Cheaper the rides the more poeople will want to ride) 
- Advertise in rural cities the benefits of ridesharing (Helps the environment?)
